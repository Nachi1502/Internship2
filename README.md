# Summer Internship 2024 - 21IT023
## 6th Semester Summer Internship

### ðŸŒŸ Full-Stack Development Internship - Project Showcase ðŸŒŸ
This project highlights my journey and achievements during my full-stack development internship. The focus was on building a mini MERN stack application with login authentication, routing, and token generation. The primary goal of this internship was to gain hands-on experience with full-stack development, including both front-end and back-end technologies, and to develop practical skills in creating secure web applications.

  - Implemented JWT token generation for authentication.
- **Day 3: Protecting Routes**
  - Set up middleware for route protection on the server.
  - Implemented protected routes on the frontend using React Router.
- **Day 4: Token Storage**
  - Configured JWT token storage in local storage on the frontend.
  - Implemented automatic token inclusion in API requests.
- **Day 5: User Profile**
  - Created a user profile page.
  - Implemented API endpoint to fetch user data using JWT.
- **Day 6: Error Handling**
  - Implemented error handling for authentication failures.
  - Displayed error messages on the frontend.

### Week 3: Enhancing the Application
**Start Date:** 17th June 2024
- **Day 1: Password Hashing**
  - Integrated bcrypt for password hashing.
  - Ensured secure storage of passwords in the database.
- **Day 2: Logout Functionality**
  - Implemented user logout by clearing JWT token.
  - Updated UI to reflect login state.
- **Day 3: Responsive Design**
  - Enhanced frontend design for better user experience.
  - Ensured the application is mobile-friendly.
- **Day 4: Testing**
